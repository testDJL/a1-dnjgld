  return 0

def favFoodsMenu():
  '''
  Return a dictionary that has a key for each of the elements returned by your myFavFoods() function. You should call that function from this one to find out what the foods are, rather than hard code it. The value for each key in the dictionary should be the length of the string. For example, if one of the foods returned by the myFavFoods() function is "pizza", then your dictionary should contain the element "pizza"->5
